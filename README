Gravitational singularity is a "point" that the Big Bang Theory called, the starting point of the Big Bang. The theory is that the universe (time-space) expands after the Big Bang at this point. The odd spot is an infinite density, infinitely high curvature of space-time, infinitely high in heat, and infinitely small volume of "points", all known laws of physics are invalidated at the odd spot. Odddo has the properties of quantum fusion and fission, and the state of the beginning of the universe is infinitely small in the geometric sense and infinite in energy. Take meaning as aggregation, infinite fission, distributed, infinite explosive force, unlimited tolerance, absorb everything.

Often referred to as distributed finance or decentralized finance, Singularity, as a true DeFi project, uses blockchain technology to achieve full decentralization, uncentralized control, coin, transaction, asset access all uncentralized, all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, open and transparent traceable can not be tampered with. Subverting traditional stock exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, etc.) and traditional digital currency centralization exchanges (fire, currency, etc.). The bottom of the platform through the latest cross-chain and side chain fusion, seamless access to a variety of digital assets for trading, using POS-DPBFT portfolio consensus algorithm, the fastest 1s can complete the consensus ledger record. TPS up to one million levels.

Singularity is an open source project, initiated by sGY Geek Tribal Decentralization, with developers around the world, and will be issuing platform coins: Singularity (SGY), with a total of 2.1 billion, with a first launch of 21 million m$21 million, and 13.75.

In the future, Singularity will combine SGY Ecology to reflect a more diverse range of DeFi and DApp applications.
